NOTA PER GUIDO
Quello che hai fatto e' enorme. Stai gettando e fondaento per il futuro che arrivera' ed
e' tutto piu' bello... E da speranza:)

Non conta il risultato, a che tu abbia messo in oto una vita diversa.
- APRITI (come non mai, perche' sta volta i messaggi sai mandarli e
          il nuclo ti chiede esattamente questo...)
- AMATI
- riprendi il tuo corpo (sex, troia muscolosa)

NOTE: a string object is immutable. Hence all methods that 'apparently' modify the string, in 
reality returns a new string and the original object is immutated.
ex:

str.replace('xx', 'yy')         Returns a new string, but str is immutated
str = str.replace('xx', 'yy')   Returns a new string and rebinds str. BUT IT'S REBINDING, NOT MUTATION

--> strings can't be MUTATED, only CREATED and BOUND to names
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Violating immutability
Immutability does not imply that the object as stored in the computer's 
memory is unwriteable. Rather, immutability is a compile-time construct 
that indicates what a programmer can do through the normal interface of 
the object, not necessarily what they can absolutely do.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

a = ['x', 'y']
# Effect:mutation, return:None
print a.append(['A', 'B'])

# Effect:nothing, return:appended
print a.__add__(['fuck', 'you'])

# Effect:mutation, return:appended
print a.__iadd__(['shit', 'cock'])

# Thus:
# a.append(LIST)    mutation (same id)
# a += LIST         mutation (same id)
# a = a + LIST     REBINDING (id changed)
#
# The last one ia a "potential" rebinding, the first twos just two object methods 
# (The second one is indeed __iadd__, nothing to do with the "bind statement" =)

M+VC (aka MODEL-VIEW ARCHITECTURE)
----------------------------------
MVC is all about separation of concerns.

The Model is responsible for managing the program's data (both private and client data). 
The View/Controller is responsible for providing the outside world with the means to 
interact with the program's client data.

The Model provides an internal interface (API) to enable other parts of the program to interact 
with it. The View/Controller provides an external interface (GUI/CLI/web form/high-level IPC/etc.) 
to enable everything outwith the program to communicate with it.

The Model is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the program's data, because 
if that gets corrupted then it's game over for everyone. The View/Controller is responsible 
for maintaining the integrity of the UI, making sure all text views are displaying up-to-date values, 
disabling menu items that don't apply to the current focus, etc.

The Model contains no View/Controller code; no GUI widget classes, no code for laying out dialog 
boxes or receiving user input.
The View/Controller contains no Model code; no code for validating URLs or performing SQL queries, 
and no original state either: any data held by widgets is for display purposes only, and merely a 
reflection of the true data stored in the Model.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now, here's the test of a true MVC design: 
  the program should in essence be fully functional even 
  without a View/Controller attached. OK, the outside world will have trouble interacting with it in 
  that form, but as long as one knows the appropriate Model API incantations, the program will hold 
  and manipulate data as normal.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why is this possible? Well, the simple answer is that it's all thanks to the low coupling between 
the Model and View/Controller layers. However, this isn't the full story. What's key to the whole 
MVC pattern is the direction in which those connection goes: 

  - ALL instructions flow from the View/Controller to the Model. 
  - The Model NEVER tells the View/Controller what to do.
  - The View/Controller is permitted to know a little about the Model (specifically, the Model's API)
  - The Model is not allowed to know anything whatsoever about the View/Controller.

Why? Because MVC is about creating a clear separation of concerns.

Why? To help prevent program complexity spiralling out of control and burying you, the developer, under it. 
The bigger the program, the greater the number of components in that program. And the more connections exist 
between those components, the harder it is for developers to maintain/extend/replace individual components, 
or even just follow how the whole system works. Ask yourself this: when looking at a diagram of the program's 
structure, would you rather see a tree or a cat's cradle? The MVC pattern avoids the latter by disallowing 
circular connections: B can connect to A, but A cannot connect to B. In this case, A is the Model and B is 
the View/Controller.

BTW, if you're sharp, you'll notice a problem with the 'one-way' restriction just described: how can the Model 
inform the View/Controller of changes in the Model's user data when the Model isn't even allowed to know that 
the View/Controller, never mind send messages to it? But don't worry: there is a solution to this, and it's rather 
neat even if it does seem a bit roundabout at first. We'll get back to that in a moment.

In practical terms, then, a View/Controller object may, via the Model's API, 
1. tell the Model to do things (execute commands), and 
2. tell the Model to give it things (return data). 

THE VIEW/CONTROLLER LAYER PUSHES INSTRUCTIONS TO THE MODEL LAYER AND PULLS INFORMATION FROM THE MODEL LAYER.

And that's where your first MyCoolListControl example goes wrong, because the API for that class requires 
that information be pushed into it, so you're back to having a two-way coupling between layers, 
violating the MVC rules and dumping you right back into the cat's cradle architecture that you were 
[presumably] trying to avoid in the first place.

Instead, the MyCoolListControl class should go with the flow, pulling the data it needs from the layer below, 
when it needs it. In the case of a list widget, that generally means asking how many values there are and then 
asking for each of those items in turn, because that's about the simplest and loosest way to do it and therefore 
keeps what coupling there is to a minimum. And if the widget wants, say, to present those values to the user in 
nice alphabetical order then that's its perogative; and its responsibility, of course.

Now, one last conundrum, as I hinted at earlier: how do you keep the UI's display synchronised with the Model's 
state in an MVC-based system?

Here's the problem: many View objects are stateful, e.g. a checkbox may be ticked or unticked, a text field may 
contain some editable text. However, MVC dictates that all user data be stored in the Model layer, so any data 
held by other layers for display purposes (the checkbox's state, the text field's current text) must therefore 
be a subsidiary copy of that primary Model data. But if the Model's state changes, the View's copy of that state 
will no longer be accurate and needs to be refreshed.

But how? The MVC pattern prevents the Model pushing a fresh copy of that information into the View layer. 
Heck, it doesn't even allow the Model to send the View a message to say its state has changed.

Well, almost. Okay, the Model layer isn't allowed to talk directly to other layers, since to do so would 
require it knows something about those layers, and MVC rules prevent that. However, if a tree falls in a 
forest and nobody's around to hear it, does it make a sound?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The answer, you see, is to set up a NOTIFICATIONS SYSTEM, providing the Model layer with a place it can 
announce to no-one in particular that it has just done something interesting. Other layers can then post 
listeners with that notification system to listen for those announcements that they're actually interested in. 
The Model layer doesn't need to know anything about who's listening (or even if anyone is listening at all!); 
it just posts an announcement and then forgets about it. And if anyone hears that announcement and feels like 
doing something afterwards - like asking the Model for some new data so it can update its on-screen display - then great. 
The Model just lists what notifications it sends as part of its API definition; and what anyone else does with that 
knowledge is up to them.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MVC is preserved, and everyone is happy. Your application framework may well provide a built-in notifications system, 
or you can write your own if not (see the 'observer pattern').

...

Anyway, hope that helps. Once you understand the motivations behind MVC, the reasons why things are done the way 
they are starts to make sense, even when - at first glance - they seem more complex than necessary.
